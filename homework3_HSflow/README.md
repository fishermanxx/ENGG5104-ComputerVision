## **Background**
Motion estimation among a sequence of images is a widely used task in computer vision, such as image segmentation, object classification, and driver assistance. 
In this community, researchers use **‘optical flow’** to describe the motion field. ‘Optical flow’ is a dense vector field, where a 2D displacement vector is calculated for each pixel. The displacement vector points to its corresponding pixel from another image.
